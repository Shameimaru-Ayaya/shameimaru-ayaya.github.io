							<div class="experience-item">
								These Sales Terms apply to all offers, orders, or contracts issued by <strong><a href="https://github.com/Shameimaru-Ayaya">GitHub@射命丸文</a> 様</strong> (the "Seller"). In case of conflict between these Terms and any buyer communications, these Terms shall prevail unless otherwise agreed in writing.
								<ul>
									<li>Pricing and Payment Terms<br>
										Unless otherwise agreed, Seller’s prices are Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) to the specified destination.<br>
										Full payment must be made prior to delivery unless otherwise agreed. Failure to pay on time entitles the Seller to:
										<ul>
											<li>Delay or cancel delivery until payment is received;</li>>
											<li>Charge interest at 0.2% per day on overdue amounts;</li>
											<li>Terminate the contract.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Delivery<br>
										Products are deemed delivered when placed under the Buyer’s control at the delivery location. Risk and title transfer upon delivery.<br>
										If delivery is delayed due to the Buyer’s actions, products are deemed delivered, and the Buyer bears storage costs.
									</li>
									<li>Inspection and Acceptance<br>
										Buyer must inspect products for quantity, specifications, and condition within 7 days of delivery. Failure to notify the Seller of discrepancies within this period constitutes acceptance.
									</li>
									<li>Product Warranty<br>
										Seller warrants that products conform to published specifications or agreed standards. Warranty lasts 24 months from delivery.<br>
										Exclusions:
										<ul>
											<li>Normal wear and tear;</li>
											<li>Defects arising after risk transfer;</li>
											<li>Buyer negligence, unauthorised modifications, or misuse;</li>
											<li>Non-compliance with technical guidelines.</li>
										</ul>
										Warranty claims require returning defective products at the Buyer’s expense. For third-party components, warranty is limited to the supplier’s terms.
									</li>
									<li>Third-Party Goods<br>
										Seller is not liable for losses arising from combining Seller’s products with third-party goods. Buyer waives all related claims.
									</li>
									<li>Intellectual Property Rights (IPR)<br>
										IPR (patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.) remain the Seller’s property. Buyer is granted a non-exclusive licence for product use. Reverse-engineering or disassembly is prohibited.
									</li>
									<li>Delays, Suspension, or Termination
										<ul>
											<li>Buyer-requested delays exceeding 30 days incur a 20% fee of the product price.</li>
											<li>Unilateral termination by Buyer entitles Seller to:
												<ul>
													<li>30% of total price for generic products;</li>
													<li>Manufacturing costs + 30% for custom products.</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>Liability for breaches is capped at the contract price or USD 50,000 (whichever is lower). Indirect losses are excluded.</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution<br>
										Contracts are governed by the laws of the Seller’s jurisdiction. Incoterms 2020 apply unless superseded by contract terms.<br>
										Disputes shall be resolved through friendly negotiation or arbitration by the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (Anhui Branch). Awards are final and binding.
									</li>
									<li>Miscellaneous<br>
										Product details in catalogues, advertisements, etc., are indicative only and non-binding.<br>
										Buyer must keep Seller’s confidential information (pricing, technical data) secure and use it solely for contractual purposes.<br>
										Notices are effective upon delivery to the recipient’s business address.<br>
										Online orders are subject to these Terms and the Website’s legal terms. Submission of an order confirms acceptance of these Terms.<br>
										For further inquiries, contact <a href="mailto:shameimaru.ayaaya@gmail.com">shameimaru.ayaaya@gmail.com</a>.
